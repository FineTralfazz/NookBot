# NookBot
This bot is designed to manage the UAF Computer Science Discord server (primarily by adding people to class-specific roles).

**I've since graduated, and am no longer maintaining this. Future development will occur on [this fork](https://github.com/computer-science-discord/nookbot).**

## Running
(Assuming you have a working Ruby installation already)

Copy `config.json.example` to `config.json` and update it with your dev server's information.
```
bundle
ruby nookbot.rb
```

## Contributing
Code should be checked with Rubocop prior to commit.
